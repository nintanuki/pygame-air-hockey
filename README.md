### Air Hockey
A simple air hockey game made in Pygame. Everything is drawn in pygame, no image files or sprites are used. I used the logic from [Clear Code's pong tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf3-aDXG8q4) to get started. However the logic behind making the physics of an air hockey game work appear to be more complicated than I anticipated. This is a work in progress. See [TODO](https://github.com/nintanuki/pygame-air-hockey/blob/main/TODO.md).
