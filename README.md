### Air Hockey
A simple air hockey game made in Pygame. Everything is drawn in pygame, no images or sprites are used. I used some of the logic from Clear Code's pong tutorial to get started. However the logic behind making the physics of an air hockey game work appear to be more complicated than I anticipated. This is a work in progress. See [TODO](https://github.com/nintanuki/pygame-air-hockey/blob/main/TODO.md).
