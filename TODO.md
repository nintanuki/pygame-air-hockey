### Game Logic
- **Allow player and puck to move faster**
- **Improve opponent AI**  
  *AI should not just chase the puck, it should try to get above it and hit it toward the player goal*
  *AI should stop chasing the puck when it is too far so it doesn't hang out in the center when the puck is on the player side*
- **Player or opponent must "serve"**
- **Add Pause function**
- **Add high score?**

### Sound
- **Add music**
- **Add sound effects**

### Issues
- **Opponent sometimes "corners" the puck in the top corners of the screen**
- **Puck still gets stuck "inside" opponent, find better solution than a cooldown timer**
- **Puck speed and physics needs tweaking, buggy**

### Code Improvements
- **Implement Delta Time**
- **Separate into classes, files and implement sprites**  
  *Too many functions just for the puck right now...*
