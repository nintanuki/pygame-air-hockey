### Physics
- **Improve Puck Physics**  

### Issues
- **Opponent sometimes"corners" the puck in the top corners of the screen**
- **Puck still gets stuck "inside" opponent, find better solution than a cooldown timer**
- **Puck speed and physics needs tweaking, buggy**
- **Player can get "stuck" on the side of the screen**
- **Puck can get "stuck" on the side of the screen**
- **Prevent opponent from hanging out in the center, limit how far down they can go**

### Game Logic
- **Improve opponent AI**  
  *AI should not just chase the puck, it should try to get above it and hit it toward the player goal*
  *AI should stop chasing the puck when it is too far so it doesn't hang out in the center when the puck is on the player side*
- **Add Pause function**
- **Add high score?**
- **Add countdown timer after each goal**
- **Clicking causes player to shoot up**

### Code Improvements
- **Implement Delta Time**
- **Separate into classes, files and implement sprites**  
  *Too many functions just for the puck right now...*
