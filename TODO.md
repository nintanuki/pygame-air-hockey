# Game Logic
- **Allow player and puck to move faster**
- **Improve opponent AI**  
  *AI should not just chase the puck, it should try to get above it and hit it toward the player goal*
  *AI should stop chasing the puck when it is too far so it doesn't hang out in the center when the puck is on the player side*
- **Add inertia to the puck (slows down over time and when hitting boundaries)**
- **Puck should not start in the center, but randomly near the opponent or the player, with slow beginning speed**
- **Player or opponent must "serve"**
- **Add Pause function**
- **Add high score?**
