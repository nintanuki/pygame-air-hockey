# Game Logic
- **Allow player and puck to move faster**
- **Improve opponent AI**  
  *AI should not just chase the puck, it should try to get above it and hit from above*
  *AI should stop chasing the puck when it is far*
- **Add inertia to the puck (slows down after a while)**
- **Add goals on the top and bottom of the screen (centered, smaller than the entire width of the screen) + game logic**
- **Add scores and high score**
- **Player or opponent must "serve"**

# Sound
- **Add music**
- **Add sound effects**
