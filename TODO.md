### Issues
- **Puck still gets stuck "inside" opponent, find better solution than a cooldown timer**
- **Player can get "stuck" on the side of the screen**
- **Puck can get "stuck" on the side of the screen or in a corner**
- **Game is too hard, opponent is a REALLY good goalie even with it's simple AI**
- **Puck slows down too much and can't be reached, institute minimum speed?**

### Room for Improvement
- **Add Pause function**
- **Add high score?**
- **Add countdown timer after each goal**
- **Add fullscreen option**
- **Improve opponent AI**  
  *AI should not just chase the puck, it should try to get above it and hit it toward the player goal*

### Ideas
- **Clicking causes player to shoot up**
- **Display different text based on scores**

### Code Improvements
- **Implement Delta Time**
- **Separate into classes, files and implement sprites**  
  *Too many functions just for the puck right now...*
